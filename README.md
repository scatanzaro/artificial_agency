**Forum for machine intelligence stakeholders to discuss organizational best practices**

I occupy two worlds. One world is inhabited by canny investors, visionary founders, and determined reporters who convince us that machine intelligence will change the way we do business and interact with both peers and machines. The other world is occupied by more cynical executives and jaded data scientists, who have tried to leverage machine intelligence capabilities, but are yet to see their organization metamorphosize into some futuristic money-making apparatus.

I empathize with the denizens of both worlds. I witnessed how machine intelligence helped the military revolutionize war games and cripple complex adversaries with non-violent means. I also struggled to lead a team that deployed deep learning for natural language processing in production (my apologies to the Mattermark data scientists for the countless mornings when I woke you up to read and manually parse 500 articles by 9:00AM). 

I genuinely believe in the transformative power of data; I’m excited by the power of GPUs and specialized hardware and by new research on neural programming. But my enthusiasm is tempered when I speak with managers who opine on the failure of their data science teams to make a measurable impact. While the press tells us that all of our jobs are in jeopardy, it’s the data scientists - those responsible for creating the agents who will one day replace us - who worry most about job security. 

So what are we doing wrong?

AI adoption does not fail due to technological shortcomings. AI adoption fails when we do not adapt our organizational processes and structures. New technology requires new behaviors and we’re still trying extract value from data science and machine learning within old bureaucratic strictures. I strongly believe that AI will not drive ROI until we address these organizational issues. 

For this reason, I’m creating a forum for stakeholders to share best practices. Hard things are really hard - and while I wish I could just prescribe the best way to set up your AI team and the most effective KPIs/OKRs/choose your acronym, I can only describe what worked well for me. My hope is that by sharing our experiences on establishing successful data science/AI team and practices, we can move the needle.

My ultimate aspiration is that companies transform every employee into a data scientist. Much like they once adopted "engineering cultures." As such, I also encourage community members to include links to training and other resources that will help their coworkers learn about and utilize data science and ML. 

The first document that I'm posting is an AI primer that I prepared for our portfolio companies. I intend this to be a living document, that my colleagues, peers, and I can update as we ourselves learn. I also urge others to share their own guidelines.

We’re creating artificial agents that learn from each other, let’s take a page from their book...
