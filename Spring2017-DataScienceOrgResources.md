## Data strategy:
- “[**Data Strategy in a World of Big Data**](https://svds.com/tbt-data-strategy-in-a-world-of-big-data/)” - John Akred (1-21-2016):
_Organizations must evaluate information value and data quality with respect to their strategic imperative and associated business objectives. Data-driven organizations must invest in scale-out architectures and prioritize data infrastructure investments based on business priorities._   
- “[**Build Algorithms Like You Give a Damn**](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/data-science-ethics/ )” - Derek Steer (8-2-2016):
_When building data science products, practitioners should consider positioning and collaborate with other stakeholders so that their analysis is best received by the intended audience. The ethical impacts of data science must be carefully reviewed._
- “[**Doing Data Science Right - Your Most Common Questions Answered**](http://firstround.com/review/doing-data-science-right-your-most-common-questions-answered/ )” - Jeremy Stanley, Daniel Tunkelang (4-8-2016): 
_Data can be used to improve product performance or strategic decision-making, although the skills required for each differ and other engineers may need to support implementation. Businesses should only use data science when the potential impact is significant, commitment to data-driven culture exists, relevant data and instrumentation is available, and heuristic or business intelligence approaches are not suitable (e.g. when the dataset or decision space is too complex). In other cases, businesses may leverage consultants or off-the-shelf solutions. When building data teams, managers should carefully consider organizational structure and mechanisms to measure and celebrate the impact of data science projects._
 
## Data-driven culture:

_To build a data-driven culture, obtain buy-in from leadership and other personnel. When encountering resistance, show detractors how data science will make them look good. _

_Data teams should be organized to ensure alignment with strategic objectives and data products should engage leadership. Data teams are most successful when their goals are explicit but contributors are not micromanaged. _
- “[**Winning with Data -Your Guide to the Data-Driven World” - Andrei Rebrov**](https://hackernoon.com/winning-with-data-your-guide-to-the-data-driven-world-9369d2cada20 ) (10-3-2016): 
_Companies should train all employees to ask the right questions from data by providing training on how to access, analyze, and present data._

 
## Data science career trajectory:
- “[**How Do I Become a Data Scientist?**](https://medium.com/@mrogati/how-do-i-become-a-data-scientist-f8074232608e)” - Monica Rogati (2-13-2017): 
_Instead of just using traditional online educational resources to learn data science, beginners should build a portfolio of data science projects wherein they prove or disprove a hypothesis with data, or build data-driven products. While working through these projects, the fledgling data scientist should learn the technologies and frameworks required for execution and presentation (e.g. visualization)._  
- “[**The Data Science Venn Diagram**](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)” - Drew Conway (3-26-2013):  
_Data scientists must learn hacking skills to acquire and clean data, mathematical and statistical skills to analyze data, and subject matter expertise to extract actionable insights from their analysis._

 
 
## Hiring data scientists:
- “[**Beginning with Ourselves**](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/beginning-with-ourselves-48c5ed46a703)” - Riley Newman, Elena Grewal (2-18-2017)
_Diverse data teams are more creative because they leverage heterogenous approaches (e.g. in working with and interpreting data). Diverse data team are also more effective in communicating results and obtaining buy-in from other stakeholders. Companies can apply a data scientific process to improve diversity hiring practices. _
- “**[Data Science at Early Stage Companies: An Intoxicating Tweet Storm](https://twitter.com/i/moments/833025919711207424)**” - Josh Wills (2-18-2017):  
_Companies should not hire data scientists until they have found product-market fit and can use data for competitive advantage. The best data scientists will not be motivated by opportunities to apply machine learning alone. _
- “[**What Are the Challenges of Building a Data Team at a Startup?**](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-challenges-of-building-a-data-team-at-a-startup/answer/Monica-Rogati)” - Monica Rogati (1-9-2017): 
_Companies should not hire machine learning developers and/or data scientists until they understand the goals of a data team and the personnel and resources (e.g. data, infrastructure) to meet those goals. Companies must also adopt data-driven cultures and organizational processes, present meaningful value propositions, and cultivate strong team leads to recruit great data scientists._  
- “[**The Data Science Delusion**](https://medium.com/@anandr42/the-data-science-delusion-7759f4eaac8e)” - Anand Ramanathan (11-18-2016):
_When hiring for a data scientists, companies must consider system complexity and modeling difficulty to understand what domain and technical expertise are required by individuals and across the team to successfully execute projects. Data scientists have heterogenous skillsets and the right hire may bear a different title._
  
 
 
## Managing data science teams:
- “[**Agile Data Science Teams Deliver Real World Results**](https://svds.com/agile-data-science-teams-deliver-real-world-results/)” - John Akred (12-8-2016): 
_Agile data science teams can more flexibly respond to unpredictable challenges. Agile data science teams can be organized around charters, which outline the purpose of the project; investigation themes; epics, sub-projects required to answer questions associated with investigation themes; and stories, units of work or tasks associated with each epic and completed in sprints. Standups and review meetings with stakeholders can facilitate progress. _
-  “[**What Does It Take to Lead Data Scientists**](https://medium.com/@dtunkelang/what-does-it-take-to-lead-data-scientists-958c8a766fc8)” - Daniel Tunkelang (9-20-2016): 
_Data science leaders should have practical experience, a rigorous approach to hiring, and strong leadership skills. They should understand their organization’s mechanics and processes and ascertain ways to deliver value._ 
- “[**Building a Team from the Inside Out: Alok Gupta on the Evolution of Data science at Airbnb**](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/09/06/building-a-team-from-the-inside-out-alok-gupta-on-the-evolution-of-data-science-at-airbnb/)” (9-16-2016):  
_Data science managers should ensure that their reports have the resources required to grow and support organization-wide data-drive decision making. Knowledge sharing and management tools make data science teams more productive and impactful._
